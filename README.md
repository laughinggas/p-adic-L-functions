# p-adic-L-functions

This project defines p-adic L-functions in terms of p-adic integrals with respect to the Bernoulli measure. We also prove that the p-adic L-functions evaluated at negative integers give values of generalized Bernoulli numbers twisted by Dirichlet and Teichmuller characters.

This work is done using Lean's mathematical library mathlib : https://leanprover-community.github.io/mathlib_docs/
